#Artificial Neurons
(artificial neurons on Silicon chips)

For the first time researchers successfully reproduced the electrical properties of biological neurons onto semiconductor chips.Artificial neurons on silicon chips that behave just like the real thing have been invented by scientists for medical devices to cure chronic diseases, such as heart failure, Alzheimerâ€™s, and other diseases of neuronal degeneration.<br/>
The artificial neurons not only behave just like biological neurons but only need one billionth the power of a microprocessor. Designing artificial neurons that respond to electrical signals from the nervous system like real neurons has been a major goal in medicine for decades, as it opens up the possibility of curing conditions where neurons are not working properly, 
have had their processes severed as in spinal cord injury, or have died.<br/>
Like an example in heart failure, neurons in the base of the brain do not respond properly to nervous system feedback, they in turn do not send the right signals to the heart, which then does not pump as hard as it should.<br/>
The researchers team(University of Bath) has successfully modelled, derived equations to explain how neurons respond to electrical stimuli from other nerves, for understanding the non-linear/ complicated responses. Hence they then designed Silicon chips that accurately modelled biological 
ion channels, before proving that their silicon neurons precisely mimicked real, living neurons responding to a range of stimulations.<br/>

#What are the benefits of Artificial Neurons?

*For medical devices to alleviate medical conditions such a neuronal degeneration, spinal cord injury and paralysis, and heart failure.<br/>
*The artificial neurons behave just like biological neurons.<br/>
*Designing artificial neurons that respond to electrical signals from the nervous system like real neurons has been a major goal.<br/>
*This opens up the possibility of curing conditions where neurons are not working properly, or have had died.<br/>
*It could repair diseased bio-circuits by replicating their healthy function and responding adequately to biological feedback to restore bodily function.<br/>
