#Heading 
#Mind of people in Programming

majority of people getting passed from 12 and entering in the engineering field are interesting in learning programming and doing some great stuff with technology.
This post will make you go through thoughts that you may come across or are already!
Yes the confusion between two programming languages ( here talking about c/c++ and python). Some c/c++ die heart fans always say that it was past, is present, and will be the future. But what's reality, is it worth learning c/c++ in 2020, or we should move toward AI,ML and WebDev .
Some people claim that python is not for placement or not for working in companies. well, that's not true. bundles of jobs are present in python and also in other languages. 


#let us make these rumors more clear 

Java:-
Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs, but they also take much less time to develop. Python programs are typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference can be attributed to Python's built-in high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python programmer wastes no time declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and dictionary types, for which rich syntactic support is built straight into the language, find a use in almost every Python program. Because of the run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For example, when evaluating the expression a+b, it must first inspect the objects a and b to find out their type, which is not known at compile time. It then invokes the appropriate addition operation, which may be an overloaded user-defined method. Java, on the other hand, can perform an efficient integer or floating point addition, but requires variable declarations for a and b, and does not allow overloading of the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.


C++:-
Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++.

Take your decision, we will be discussing more about this later!<br/> This is python devloper siging off!!!
