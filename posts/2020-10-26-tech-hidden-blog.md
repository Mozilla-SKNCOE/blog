WIRELESS CHARGING MARKET</br>

Hidden tech is a growing market. Many consumers consider large electronic devices to be unsightly – they wish for technology that is hidden until required. <br>
One such example is the global wireless charging market, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 60.22% between 2017 and 2025 – estimated at 
USD 3,346.91 million in 2017, it is expected to reach USD 145,337.92 million by 2025.
Many of us will already use hidden tech – watches that measure your exercise, mirrors that aid your work out, automobile keys that unlock only by proximity, 
cable boxes that communicate by wireless local area network(WLAN), and a wide variety of products utilizing radio-frequency identification (RFID). This includes cellphone 
payment systems, smart utility meters, and store anti-theft devices.<br>

<h3>WHAT ARE THE MAIN STANDARDS?</h3>

It depends on what market you are targeting and what the product is. For example, a table with wireless charging capabilities needs to conform to both furniture and electrical and electronic (E&E) standards. Regulations will also differ between markets, although there may be overlap.<br>
A good starting point for manufacturers is IEC 62368-1:2018 Audio/video, information and communication technology equipment – Part 1: Safety requirements. Recognized in many markets, this is the main safety standard for devices.<br>
It should be noted that Bluetooth and WLAN are only two among many IoT technologies that manufacturers must consider when looking at accessing markets around the globe. Others include ANT+, LoRa, and Z-Wave.<br>

<h3>SMOOTH ROUTES TO COMPLIANCE</h3>

Accessing markets with hidden tech products can be complex. It is advisable to seek guidance from a certification provider that has considerable experience in working with different product types and markets.<br> 
With a worldwide network of E&E laboratories and experience in accessing all major global markets, SGS is the first choice for businesses operating in the hidden tech market. They have considerable experience in performing EMC and RF testing, alongside comprehensive quality, safety and performance testing solutions for E&E and other consumer products.<br>
