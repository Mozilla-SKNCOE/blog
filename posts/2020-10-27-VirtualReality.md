#VIRTUAL REALITY (VR)

When we talk about Virtual Reality, many of us think of science fiction films. However, the truth is that nowadays this technology completely blends in with our daily lives. Video games, medicine, education...<br/>
Virtual Reality is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. allows us to immerse ourselves in video games as if we were one of the characters, learn how to perform heart surgery or improve the quality of sports training to maximise performance.<br/>

Although this may seem extremely futuristic, its origins are not as recent as we might think. In fact, many people consider that one of the first Virtual Reality devices was called Sensorama, a machine with a built-in seat that played 3D movies, gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as vivid as possible.<br/>
A technology that originated decades ago, many people are still unfamiliar with the concept of Virtual Reality. It is also quite common to confuse the term Virtual Reality with augmented reality.<br/>

Virtualy Reality is fully immersive and everything we see is part of an environment artificially constructed through images, sounds, etc. And, in augmented reality (AR), our own world becomes the framework within which objects, images or similar are placed.<br/>

Let's discuss the applications of Virtual Reality. Medicine, culture, education and architecture are some of the areas that have already taken advantage of this technology. And many unimaginable technologies are there.<br/>

#Innovative uses for Virtual Reality
Dining, Medicine, Media, Education, entertainment, Architecture, Industry, CultureAndArt, Military, etc...<br/>

#Future of Virtual Reality
Nowadays, the market is demanding applications more affordable for users. Virtual interfaces also need to be improved to avoid defects such as clipping, or to minimise the effects that VR produces in people, among them motion sickness, which consists of a dizziness induced by the mismatch between the movement of our body and what is being seen in the virtual world.
The Big Technology companies are developing Virtual Reality headsets in 8K and with much more powerful processors. There is even talk that in the next few years they could integrate Artificial Intelligence. The latest 5G standard can also provide very interesting scenarios for the evolution of VR. This standard will allow more devices and large user communities to be connected.<br/>

All this means that, the Virtual Reality is integrated into our present and, in the coming years, it will lead to advances that will shape the future.<br/>
