                                                          SELF-DRIVING CAR TECHNOLOGY

The current Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) provide important safety functions such as collision warnings, steering assistance, automatic braking, etc. 
</br>
There are levels to autonomy which consists of 5 levels:
</br>
LEVEL 0: The system has no control over the vehicle, but may prompt the driver hazards.
</br>
LEVEL 1: The driver and the automated system share the control of the vehicle. (Found on mostly equipped ADAS cars).
</br>
LEVEL 2: The automated system is capable of controlling the whole vehicle, but the driver must be ready to interrupt 
         if the system fails to recognize any hazard.
</br>
LEVEL 3: Automated system takes full control of the vehicle and driver can safely take away itâ€™s attention from driving 
         tasks, but sometimes might need to intervene.
</br>
LEVEL 4: The driver can safely take its attention away from the driving tasks and let the automated system take full control. This functionality is limited 
         to specific geofenced areas and controlled environments.
