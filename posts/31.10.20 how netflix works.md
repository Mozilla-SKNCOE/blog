                                                      HUNDREDS OF MICROSERVICES AND ONE GIANT SERVICE: NETFLIX
</br>                                                    
Netflix has ushered in a revolution around ten years ago by rewriting the applications that run the entire service 
to fit into a microservices architecture, which means that each application, or microserviceâ€™s code and resources are it's very own.

</br>

Netflix uses around 700 microservices to control each part which makes up the entire Netflix service: 
one microservice store what all shows you watched, one deducts the monthly fee from your credit card, 
one provides your device with the correct video files that it can play, one takes a look at your 
watching history and uses algorithms to guess a list of movies that you will like, 
and one will provide the names and images of these movies to be shown in a list on the main menu. 

</br>

Netflix engineers can make changes to any part of the application and can introduce new changes rapidly
while ensuring that nothing else in the entire service breaks down.
