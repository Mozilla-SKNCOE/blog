The basic idea of augmented reality is to superimpose graphics, audio, and other sensory enhancements over real-time.
Televisions have been doing this with graphics for decades and AR is just more advanced than any television technology.

  Manufacturers are so certain of AR’s success that they are developing devices that are meant to focus on enhancing the AR experience.
Two of the tech leaders Google and Apple- continue to develop their mobile devices such that it can handle the demands of AR-specific software. 
ASUS has made the Zenfone AR hoping to make an early entrance in the AR directed market.

  Facebook has its own AR studio, which helps developers create AR apps meant specifically to work on its own framework. Google is working on the Tango platform, 
which supports visual search capabilities through Google Lens. Apple has also developed ARKit that arms programmers with the code they need to dive into the 
AR app operation for iPhones and other iOS-driven devices.

  Over the next few years, we’ll likely to see jumps in the evolution of the AR concept in both software, hardware, and a surfeit of new applications.
